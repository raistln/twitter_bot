      "They say sarcasm shows weakness, but who gives a crap what they think?! While some may think that sarcasm is a slippery slope, others believe that sarcasm is actually a sign of intellect. After all, it was Oscar Wilde who wrote, “Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit but the highest form of intelligence.”\n",
      "See? Us sarcastic people, we’re freakin’ smart! In all seriousness though, there’s even some scientific merit to such claims. One study from 2015, covered by Scientific American, found that sarcasm can actually increase creativity flow. Think about it: Sarcasm doesn’t come from nowhere. You have to be pretty crafty and clever to whip up a sarcastic comment on the spot. In some ways, sarcasm is creativity. It might even spark creativity in other ways, too!\n",
      "Tread carefully though—on the other end of the spectrum, many therapists warn that sarcasm could significantly impair relationships. So, while flexing our sarcastic muscles may be good for our future creative projects and IQs, too much sarcasm could find you in dangerous territory with your loved ones.\n",
